        text: "Formule ETS is a Formula SAE team composed of engineering students from the École de Technologie Supérieure in Montreal. The Collegiate Design Series competition brings together over 600 teams from universities around the world. They compete by presenting a business plan to judges, by describing their vehicle design philosophy, by creating a project cost list and by competing against the best teams in Formula SAE races. <br/><br/> In the past, we have distinguished ourselves from our competitors by having the lightest vehicle, by demonstrating exemplary vehicle finishing and by repeatedly reaching the podium. Formule ETS has been designing combustion cars since 1988 and is now designing electric cars since 2020.",

        text: `Formule ETS has been designing and building race cars for the purpose of competing in Formula SAE for over 30 years now with the same goal in mind: "WINNING" <br/><br/> The vehicles that come out of the Formule ETS shop reflect our design philosophy. Thus, we relentlessly pursue the design of the lightest vehicle, year after year. <br/><br/> Our first electric car, MANIC-20, weighs 195 kg and is powered by four AMK motors located inside of each wheel. MANIC-20 is equipped with 16-inch Hoosier tires mounted on aluminum wheels with custom designed brake calipers. `,
